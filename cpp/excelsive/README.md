# Totally Unnecessary TimeCard utility

Some arcaic organizations like Barrett Business Services, Inc require employees to pass around excel files to fill in timecard information. Luckily, I'm brushing up on my C++ and needed a project.


This will take a single argument and spit out the BBSI formatted excel file.

Example: ```./excelsive m:1pm-5pm,t:11:15am-3pm,w:off,th:9am-12pm,f:1pm-6pm,sa:9am-12pm,su:1:30pm-5:30pm```
